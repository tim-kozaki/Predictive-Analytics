# Predictive-Analytics - Python (Basics)

What is <b>Data</b> and why does everyone care so much about it? The Oxford Dictionary defines Data as facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. Foundamentally, Data can tell us so much about what has happened and what is going on. <b>Predictions</b>, calculated guesses or forecasts, are extracted from data.

<b>Predictive Analytics</b> is a tool that uses data to let us know about the future by extracting usable information and make accurate predictions. These predictions empowers businesses to make informed decisisions that are impactful and effective. This topic aims to explore predictive analytics with Python (using Jupyter Notebook), to cover the basic fundamentals of how to prepare data and use prebuilt Python libraries to create and evaluate prediction models.

## Roadmap: Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
- <b>Business Understanding:</b> Define your goal.
- <b>Data Understanding:</b> Familiarize yourself to the data, and understand the data types.
- <b>Data Preparation:</b> Prepare and clean the data for modeling. 
- <b>Modeling:</b> Data is put to work to create a prediction. 
- <b>Evaluation/Validation:</b> Check how effective is the model in predicting the test data.
- <b>Deployment:</b> Implement the successful prediction model.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and explain how predictive analytics supports decision-making.
- Understand the necessity of data preparation.
- Identify the different data types that are used.
- Effectively apply Python code to produce optimal results.
- Understand the differences between predictive models available.


## Business Understanding

First of all, we need a destination. Domain knowledge and understanding of the problem is very important in trying to find solutions.  
"A car without a destination is useless".

Before embarking on a project, <b>define your goal.</b>

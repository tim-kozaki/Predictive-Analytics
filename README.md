# Predictive-Analytics - Python (Basics)

What is <b>Data</b> and why does everyone care so much about it? The Oxford Dictionary defines Data as facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. Foundationally, <b>Data</b> can tell us so much about what has happened and what is going on. 

Predictive analytics is a tool that uses data to let us know about the future by extracting usable information and make accurate predictions. These predictions empowers businesses to make informed decisisions that are impactful and effective. This topic aims to explore predictive analytics with Python (using Jupyter Notebook), to cover the basic fundamentals of how to prepare data and use prebuilt Python libraries to create and evaluate prediction models.
